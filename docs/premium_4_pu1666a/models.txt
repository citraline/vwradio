PU-1582A
  Segment display driven by NEC uPD16431A
  Footprint for Toshiba TC9212F (not usually populated)
  No footprint for Epson RTC-4543

PU-1634A
  Like PU-1582A but has no footprint for TC9212F.  Instead, it has a
  footprint for an Epson RTC-4543 in the same area.  The RTC always
  seems to be populated.

PU-1666A
  Like PU-1634A but has a dot matrix display driven by NEC uPD16432B.

PU-1667A
  Like PU-1666A but with a different face assembly for the New Beetle.  The
  dot matrix display on PU-1667A is very similar to PU-1666A but has
  different pictographs.
