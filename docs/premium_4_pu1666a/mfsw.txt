Button          Code    Complete Packet
------          ----    ---------------
Volume Down     0x00    41E880FF
Volume Up       0x80    41E8807F
Down            0x50    41E850AF
Up              0xD0    41E8D02F

All codes 0x00-0xFF were tried and only the ones listed above had
any noticeable effect on the radio.

The "Up" and "Down" buttons perform the version of "seek" for each mode:

Button      AM/FM Mode  CD Mode     Tape Mode
------      ---------   -------     ---------
Down        Seek Down   Track Down  MSS REW
Up          Seek Up     Track Up    MSS FF

In CD mode, "Track Down" works like the faceplate.  Pressing it once
returns to 0:00 on the current track.  Pressing it again quickly
performs track down.
