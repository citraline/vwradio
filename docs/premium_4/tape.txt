SCA4.4 (Module with TDA3612
---------------------------

FE/ME:
    output
    metal tape indicator:
        low = non-metal tape
        high = metal tape

MONITOR:
    output
    error condition indicator:
        low = error
        high = no error

SWITCH:
    output
    no tape = constant low
    tape in, not playing = constant high
    play tape:
        ENABLE high->low
        286 ms delay
        SWITCH high->low
        337 ms delay
        SWITCH low->high
        77 ms delay
        SWITCH high->low
        (SWITCH stays low until STOP is pressed, then goes constant high)

ENABLE:
    input
    idles high, radio pulls low to select TDA3612

DATA:
    input
    idles high

CLOCK:
    bidirectional
    idles high
    if ENABLE=low, the radio has selected the TDA3612, and drives
      CLOCK to shift bits out on DATA
    if ENABLE=high, and a cassette is playing, the TDA3612 pulses
      the CLOCK line continuously (tachometer?): 25ms off, 1ms on.
    while playing, if the clock pulses are interrupted for about 500ms(?),
      the radio will report a side switch (e.g. "PLAY A" -> "PLAY B").


TDA3612 SPI Commands
--------------------

Play            0x54
Stop            0x62


Simulating Play
---------------

configure FE/ME as output, set it permanently low (non-metal tape)
configure MONITOR as output, set it permanently high (no error condition)
configure ENABLE as input, CLOCK as input, SWITCH as output
set SWITCH high
wait for ENABLE high->low
delay 286 ms
set SWITCH low
delay 337 ms
set SWITCH high
delay 77 ms
set SWITCH low
set CLOCK as output
loop forever:
  set CLOCK high for 25ms
  set CLOCK low for 1ms


Simulating Stop
---------------

set SWITCH high
stop pulsing CLOCK
