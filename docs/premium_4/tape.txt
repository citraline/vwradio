FE/ME:
    metal tape indicator, don't care
MONITOR:
    always 5V
SWITCH:
    no tape = 0v
    tape in, not playing = 5v constant
    play tape:
        ENABLE high->low
        2426 ms delay
        SWITCH high->low
        3366 ms delay
        SWITCH low->high
        75 ms delay
        SWITCH high->low
        (SWITCH stays low until STOP is pressed, then goes constant high)


simulator:
    set FE/ME as output, permanently high or low, don't care
    set MONITOR as output, permanently high
    ENABLE as input, SWITCH as output
    set SWITCH high
    wait for ENABLE high->low
    delay 2426 ms
    set SWITCH low
    delay 3366 ms
    set SWITCH high
    delay 75 ms
