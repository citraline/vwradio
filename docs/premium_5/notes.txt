Single Disc CD Player
---------------------

The in-dash single disc CD player (1J0 035 119 A) will not function with the
Premium 5 radio unless the player is grounded separately (the radio will display
`NO CHANGER`).  The cable between the radio and the player is not enough.
Ground anywhere on the player's chassis to make it work.  There is a 2-pin
connector on the back of the player; this is presumably where the player
gets its ground from where installed in the car.

Interestingly, the player seems to work fine on the Premium 4 radio without
having to ground the chassis.  It's a good idea to ground it anyway.
