# FIS Emulator

This project partially emulates an FIS instrument cluster.  It connects to a
Premium 4 or Premium 5 radio via VW 3LB (3 line bus) like a real FIS cluster
would.  It reads the data from the radio that would be shown on the upper
two lines of an FIS cluster.

Skeleton only, nothing working yet.
